This is an Art-Gallery-DataBase. It is built so that you can manage the gallery you own, run or work in efficiently and easily. This application will be suitable for you especially if you need to keep track of your artworks and if you also have your own lab for their maintenance, the exhibitions success as far as the attendance is concerned and the exchange of art pieces with external foundations. 
Firstly, you should download the three files from the repository and always have them in the same folder. 
Optionally, you can run the “SQLite_CreateTables.py” file. The schema of the database is going to be created in the same folder under the name “DBGallery.db”. Then, run the “SQLite_InsertData.py”. This is going to insert the data into the database. You can now use the file “DBGallery.db” to browse your database in any application that can read a .db file.
In order to use the application you should run the “SQLite_Python.py'' file. This will run the two aforementioned files and create the “DBGallery.db” file on its own. A menu with 8 options is going to appear with information and an example on how to use each mode.
